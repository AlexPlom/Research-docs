# MCP servers â€” brief overview

### MCP Servers

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers are backend services that expose structured data, tools, or capabilities to AI models (like ChatGPT) in a standardized way. They act as context providers or extensions, allowing a model to query, retrieve, or modify information through well-defined interfaces.

### MCP servers can be used to:

- Expose APIs, databases, or local tools to the model in a controlled environment.

- Provide real-time data or specialized domain knowledge (e.g., project repositories, internal documentation, or task systems).

- Implement custom workflows or actions that the model can invoke safely and transparently.

Each MCP server communicates with the AI model through the Model Context Protocol, ensuring secure, auditable, and sandboxed interactions.
